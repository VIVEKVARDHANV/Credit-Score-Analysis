# Credit Score Classification

## Overview
This project implements a credit score classification system using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict credit score categories for individuals based on various financial and demographic features. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scaling, and encoding, followed by model training and evaluation.

## Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding dataset characteristics and distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.
3. **Model Building:** Implementation of models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN.
4. **Evaluation:** Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
5. **SMOTE:** Addressing class imbalance through oversampling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SMOTE (for class balancing)
